# robot-path-planner
A path planning simulation for an Arduino-powered robot that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute optimal routes for picking up and dropping off boxes on a 2D grid. This code focuses on generating paths only; it does not yet include physical robot control or motor interfacing.
